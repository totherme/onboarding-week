[RELEASE] First, do "Services: Redis CUPS"
---
Build a service broker
### What?
You've already used `cf cups` to tell your CF app how to access a redis that
you already had credentials for. But suppose we want to provide a large number
of app developers access to a service like redis, without either:
1. giving them all exactly the same username and password -- seems like a
  security risk
1. manually creating a new redis account for every single user that comes
  asking -- seems like a lot of work

The answer is to write a program that can create a new redis account for each
user that comes asking, and give that user the credentials to only their own
account.
